# Apple Magic Trackpad 2 configuration
# Inspired by examples found in the github repository p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack 

# See main comments on `50-mtrack.conf`.

# Input class sections provide configurations for a class of input devices as
# they are automatically added. An input device can match more than one
# InputClass section. Each class can override settings from a previous class,
# so it is best to arrange the sections with the most generic matches first.
# For this reason, we place this file, `60-magictrack.conf`, after
# `40-libinput.conf` and `50-mtrack.conf`, otherwise the options in here will
# not come into effect.
