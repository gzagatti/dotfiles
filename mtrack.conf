# Trackpad configuration
# Inspired by examples found in the github repository p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack 

# This config file should be placed in the search path for xorg.conf. In Ubuntu
# 20.04 this means at `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d`. For more information on the
# syntax of this file and background on Xorg X Server configuration see `man
# xorg.conf`

# This configuration is only valid for the xf86-input-mtrack driver installed
# from https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack To build and install the
# package in Ubuntu 20.04, install the dependency `xorg-dev` with `apt`. In
# Ubuntu 20.04 this library is installed in
# `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig`. In order to configure the driver
# correctly, make sure that pkg-config is pointing to this path. Configure the
# package with `./configure`. Then build the package with `dpkg-buildpackage
# --nosign` (the flag avoids signing issues, though make sure you trust the
# codebase).  Finally, move to the parent directory and install the apt package
# with `apt-install xserver-xorg-input-mtrack_0.5.0_amd64.deb`.

# Add the user to the `input` group, `sudo usermod -a -G input <user>` in order
# to enable her/him to use the trackpad, otherwise the trackpad will be frozen
# next time she/he logs in.

# Input class sections provide configurations for a class of input devices as
# they are automatically added. An input device can match more than one
# InputClass section. Each class can override settings from a previous class,
# so it is best to arrange the sections with the most generic matches first.
# For this reason, we place this file, 50-mtrack.conf, after
# `40-libinput.conf`, otherwise these options will not come into effect.
